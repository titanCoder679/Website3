    <h1>Threads</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Multithreading is a Java feature that allows concurrent execution of two or more parts of a program for maximum utilization of CPU. Each part of such program is called a thread. So, threads are light-weight processes within a process.</p>
    <p>Threads can be created by using two mechanisms :</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Extending the Thread class </li>
        <li>Implementing the Runnable Interface</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Thread creation by extending the Thread class:</p>
    <p>We create a class that extends the java.lang.Thread class. This class overrides the run() method available in the Thread class. A thread begins its life inside run() method. We create an object of our new class and call start() method to start the execution of a thread. Start() invokes the run() method on the Thread object.</p>
    <p>Thread creation by implementing the Runnable Interface:</p>
    <p>
        We create a new class which implements java.lang.Runnable interface and override run() method. Then we instantiate a Thread object and call start() method on this object.</p>
        <p>Thread Class vs Runnable Interface</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                If we extend the Thread class, our class cannot extend any other class because Java doesnâ€™t support multiple inheritance. But, if we implement the Runnable interface, our class can still extend other base classes.
            </li>
            <li>We can achieve basic functionality of a thread by extending Thread class because it provides some inbuilt methods like yield(), interrupt() etc. that are not available in Runnable interface.</li>
            <li>Using runnable will give you an object that can be shared amongst multiple threads. </li>
        </ol>
